And while I was unable to particularly identify what that may be, my experiences in different clubs and with different individuals helped narrow my career interests to specific fields like media, digital marketing, product management, administration and more.My most recent full-time role was a niche industry that focused on automotive media. While I would not consider myself an auto enthusiast that gets excited about ICEs or latest trims, I found it to be an amazing opportunity to try and learn something new. It’s truly amazing to be surrounded by passionate and hard-working individuals; allowing myself to be open minded offers new perspectives, knowledge, and experiences. In my next role, I hope to work for a company with personnel that recognizes my strengths and potential. I love when I can gain hands-on experience in a collaborative and interactive setting. Personally, I thrive in supportive environments that offer constructive criticism/accountability while also allowing the freedom to make my own decisions without micromanagement.
