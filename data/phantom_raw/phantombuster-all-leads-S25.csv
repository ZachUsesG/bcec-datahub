Though my “salary” often came in the form of trips to Chuck E. Cheese or video games, those experiences gave me an early glimpse into the world of entrepreneurship. Watching my family navigate challenges, learn from mistakes, and build successful ventures inspired my passion for business and the drive to understand how organizations grow and succeed.As a student at UC Berkeley’s Haas School of Business, I focus on entrepreneurship, management, and financial planning to build a strong foundation for my career. I am eager to apply my skills and explore opportunities that will allow me to tackle challenges and contribute to meaningful projects. Outside of academics, I enjoy listening to podcasts, playing basketball, and following the Lakers and Team India for cricket. I’m always excited to learn, share ideas, and connect with others who share similar passions.Feel free to reach out if you’d like to connect!Email: aryan03@berkeley.edu","Organization Skills, Communication, Teamwork, Contract Negotiation, Customer Service, Creative Problem Solving, Hospitality Industry, Advertising, Point of Sale (POS) Systems, Customer Database Management",Haas Business Student Association (HBSA),https://linkedin.com/company/berkeleyhbsa,berkeleyhbsa,Lead,Sep 2024 - Present,"Berkeley, California, United States",,,"University of California, Berkeley, Haas School of Business",https://www.linkedin.com/school/berkeley-haas,berkeley-haas,Bachelor of Science - BS,,Grade: 4.0 • Dean's List & HonorsHaas Pre-Core ProgramCal Alumni Association (CAA) Award RecipientHAAS External Case CompetitionEHUB Test TrackHAAS Thrive Fellow,Irvine Valley College,https://www.linkedin.com/school/irvine-valley-college,irvine-valley-college,Associate's degree,Aug 2022 - May 2024,,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?facetNetwork=%5B%22F%22%5D&facetConnectionOf=%5B%22ACoAADs8lCoBGmomdQ4VuHDGxx8uVn4p8BEisYY%22%5D&origin=MEMBER_PROFILE_CANNED_SEARCH&RESULT_TYPE=PEOPLE,aryan-chaudhari-,calrootsconsulting,993825834,ACoAADs8lCoBGmomdQ4VuHDGxx8uVn4p8BEisYY,No,No,1656714180064783,Out of Network,12/22/2025,12/22/2025,SP25,SP25
