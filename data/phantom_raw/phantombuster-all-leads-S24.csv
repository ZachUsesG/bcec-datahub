Growing up with a passion for public speaking and leadership, I engaged in opportunities early on to develop these essential skills.As a student-athlete in soccer, swimming, volleyball, and basketball, I found my passions centered around teamwork and collaborative spaces. Despite the challenges of being the co-captain of my high school's women's varsity basketball team, including facing microaggressions and discrimination, I persevered.When the opportunity to write a TEDEd talk emerged, I channeled my passion for gender rights and advocacy, drawing from my experiences as an athlete. I spoke on the role of women in sports, combining this with my academic pursuit in economics to address inequitable wages in different sports fields. This accomplishment stands as my proudest, acting as a catalyst for my SHE-EO and girl boss mentality.My aim is to be a role model for other young girls of color, empowering them to feel heard in the historically male-dominated spheres of business and consulting. This journey has fueled my commitment to equity, diversity, and inclusion, driving me to break down barriers and inspire positive change.Excited about contributing my unique perspective to initiatives aligned with my values at UC Berkeley, I am confident that my diverse experiences make me a valuable asset to your esteemed institution.Mikkah Damji Student TEDEd Talk: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDygkvoPP-wMarketing Portfolio: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OxyR15uv_l9NUBMu956cQujLHYbJX5QdYQ37nUAzXKs/edit?usp=drive_link","Business Development Support, Search Engine Optimization (SEO), Business Analysis, Diversity & Inclusion, Social Media Marketing, creative thinking, Sports, Training, Strategic Leadership, Team Management, risk taking, Confidence Building, Business Networking, service networking, Interpersonal Communication, Intercultural Awareness, Creativity and Innovation, Project Coordination, Community Outreach, Strategic Communications",Alpha Phi International Fraternity,https://linkedin.com/company/alpha-phi-international-fraternity,alpha-phi-international-fraternity,"Vice President of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion of Alpha Phi",Jan 2024 - Dec 2024,"Berkeley, California, United States",,,"University of California, Berkeley",https://www.linkedin.com/school/uc-berkeley,uc-berkeley,Bachelor of Arts - BA,Aug 2022 - Apr 2026,,UCL,https://www.linkedin.com/school/university-college-london,university-college-london,Semester Abroad,Jan 2025 - May 2025,,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?facetNetwork=%5B%22F%22%5D&facetConnectionOf=%5B%22ACoAADhuZ-sBs0zx2poWi4FIy-M-5ask-6YYOsE%22%5D&origin=MEMBER_PROFILE_CANNED_SEARCH&RESULT_TYPE=PEOPLE,mikkahdamji,,946759659,ACoAADhuZ-sBs0zx2poWi4FIy-M-5ask-6YYOsE,No,No,4588034905029115,Out of Network,12/22/2025,12/22/2025,SP24,SP24
