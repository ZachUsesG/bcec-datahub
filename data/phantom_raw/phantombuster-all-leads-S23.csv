I saw this movie as a little kid and from then – until I got the chance to work with an environmental NGO – my passion and obsession was becoming a marine biologist. However, once I got to pursue this interest at the WWF, where I analyzed datasets pertaining to different ecosystems of the Pacific Ocean, I realized something about myself: it was not the science or the shark itself I found profoundly fascinating, but rather the story. From then onwards I knew my passion was storytelling. However, this short internship taught me something else about myself: I love telling stories with data. Stories that are convincing and that lead to outcomes, since there is evidence to support them. Skipping some non-essential details, and having learned more along the way, I realized that what profoundly drives me within storytelling is media. My mission is to make sure that the stories that are meant to be told reach as many members of the right audience as possible. Without disregarding my inclination to use data in my everyday, I combined these seemingly unrelated passions through my time in college: I double-majored in Economics and Film at UC Berkeley, aiming to learn more about decision-making.Through my club and internship experience, I got to learn about this intersection by conducting meaningful work in entertainment. I explored B2C Marketing, Market Research, Consumer Insights, Experiential Marketing, B2B Marketing, Content Distribution, and Ad Sales. All of these experiences were fantastic and allowed me to “narrow down” my areas of interest to the following: Consumer/Content Insights and Analytics, Marketing/Brand Strategy, Product Marketing & Product Management, Content Distribution & Acquisition, Ad Sales Operations & Planning, and Account Management.

For as long as I can remember, I have strived to inspire and make others happier through my creativity and imagination. I developed my passions for content creation in the classroom of my middle school yearbook club. And in those years prior to attending college, I found myself sinking into perfecting the smallest of details and bringing my joy to those around me. At UC Berkeley, I pushed my message further by tapping into the world of business, marketing, and analytics. My love for creating and visualizing stories conceived itself in projects I worked on for companies such as Snapchat and Adobe. With internships at Warner Bros. Discovery and NBCUniversal, I continued to enhance my skills and worked alongside industry professionals to touch the lives of millions. My mission of utilizing and spreading creativity does not stop at the jobs and projects I have worked on. UC Berkeley's CalTV and BCEC are heavily at the root of guiding me to who I am today and who I want to be in the future. By taking on leadership positions here, I have been able give back and impact others who have similar intentions as myself. At heart, I am someone who just wants to make the world a better place.

From my childhood bedroom window, I saw brands trying to hop on these fleeting buses, that never stay for too long, hoping to catch the ride to relevance. And I realised that only the students, who have been riding these buses for years and know the schedule by heart, truly knew which bus to catch and when. They navigate the ever-changing landscape effortlessly, making them the perfect partners for forward-thinking brands. That's the idea behind Muses, the heart of student-driven services, a company connecting raw student talent with companies hungry for fresh, genuine ideas. At Muses, we decode Gen-Z culture from the inside out, transforming cultural codes into measurable market gold. By embedding ourselves into the integrated landscapes of social media and offline activations, we help global brands navigate the complex intersection of commerce and culture among Gen-Z. Our track record shows that when brands speak Gen-Z's language authentically, they don't just capture attention – they capture market share. Through strategic cultural engineering, we bridge the gap between boardroom strategies and dorm room conversations, creating campaigns that feel native to youth culture while driving bottom-line results. In a world where cultural relevance determines market relevance, we help brands become part of the conversation, not just sponsors of it.If you're curious about the future of Gen-Z and creativity, let's connect!","Trend Analysis, Trend Forecasting, Brand Strategy, Consumer Insight, Product Development, Mobile Product Development, Newsletter Writing, Strategic Content Development, Media Relations, Public Relations, Startups, Early-Stage Startups, Lean Startup, Startup Development, Product Management, Product Marketing, Web Analytics, Go-to-Market Strategy, Email Marketing, Leadership",Warner Bros.

With a strong foundation in cognitive science and data science from UC Berkeley, coupled with hands-on experience in product design, marketing strategies, and data analytics, I specialize in translating complex challenges into intuitive, data-driven user experiences.My journey has been shaped by a dual focus:- UX Design: I’ve spearheaded UX projects that significantly enhance app functionality and user engagement by combining deep user empathy with rigorous research and data analysis.- Data Science: My analytical skills allow me to dive into data, uncover insights, and apply them to improve user experiences. Whether it’s predicting customer behavior, analyzing market trends, or optimizing design strategies, data is at the core of my decision-making process.Why does this dual focus matter? Because I believe that great design isn’t just about how something looks or feels—it’s about how it works, and data plays a crucial role in making that happen. My proficiency in tools like Figma, Dovetail, and Adobe Suite, alongside coding skills in Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib, allows me to craft designs that are both creative and evidence-based. From A/B testing to data visualization, I leverage every tool at my disposal to create experiences that are not only user-friendly but also data-informed.At the heart of my work is a passion for solving interesting problems and the belief that the intersection of art, technology, and human behavior is where the most impactful solutions are born. I’m excited to continue exploring how data can inform design and vice versa, and I am eager to connect with professionals and organizations that share my vision for creating meaningful, data-driven experiences.Let’s connect and explore how we can use data and design to make a difference.","User Experience Design (UED), Marketing Strategy, Social Media Marketing, User Interface Prototyping, Product Design, Market Research, Strategic Consulting, User Interface Design, Program Budgeting, Residential Services, UX Research, Microsoft Excel, Youth Mentoring, Public Speaking, Online Tutoring, Copywriting, User Experience Writing, Adobe InDesign, Employee Training, Office Operations","University of California, Berkeley",https://linkedin.com/company/uc-berkeley,uc-berkeley,Resident Assistant,Aug 2022 - May 2024,,,,"University of California, Berkeley",https://www.linkedin.com/school/uc-berkeley,uc-berkeley,Bachelor of Arts - BA,Aug 2021 - May 2025,,,,,,,,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?facetNetwork=%5B%22F%22%5D&facetConnectionOf=%5B%22ACoAADhWKKwBSsEvvPETkM0Grn7ShmfihdHW9wY%22%5D&origin=MEMBER_PROFILE_CANNED_SEARCH&RESULT_TYPE=PEOPLE,amritavinjamury,crateapp,945170604,ACoAADhWKKwBSsEvvPETkM0Grn7ShmfihdHW9wY,No,No,4435781165402463,Out of Network,12/22/2025,12/22/2025,SP23,SP23

I’m Lorianne. I graduated from UC Berkeley with a dual honors B.A. in both Linguistics and Interdisciplinary Studies. My research interest lies within the intersection of language, identity, and public engagement. Across my projects, I employ both qualitative and quantitative methods, combining corpus analysis, acoustic phonetics, and ethnographic approaches to explore language as a multifaceted system.

Growing up in Burbank, the home of some of the biggest entertainment studios, I've always had a fascination with film production and analysis. For four years before the pandemic, I was accepted into the special film program at my school, where we worked directly with those same studios while also participating in the pre-production, production, and post-production of my own professional films.I was particularly attracted to the pre-production portion of the films, where I found my writing and analysis skills most useful. I became so invested in film production, that my teacher eventually took me under his professional mentorship, where he helped prosper my skills as a writer and analyst. My dedication to my work bled into my free time, where I would spend hours either researching film methods and storytelling or hearing podcasts on film analysis and structure. Though the pandemic has made it difficult to go back to my hands-on work, I've taken a plethora of English classes in college more than is necessary to always feed onto my fondness and attachment to film. My own films have been screened at Walt Disney Studios and my written work has been a contender for the best documentary short.
