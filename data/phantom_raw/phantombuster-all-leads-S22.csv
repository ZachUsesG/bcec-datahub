I also host weekly LIVE resume and LinkedIn review sessions on TikTok, which have drawn 120K+ unique viewers since May and grown my platform by 9K+ followers, giving me direct feedback loops that translate into action-ready insights.On the brand side, I’ve produced ~32 short-form videos monthly for K-beauty brands at Memebox, developed training videos for 100K+ Macy’s and Ulta sales associates, and optimized creative variants to improve ad conversions. At Udemy, I launched the brand’s Threads presence, landed PR coverage in top media outlets including Forbes, won 4 product & company awards, and leveraged analytics dashboards to construct quarterly learning indexes that identified trends in global workplace learning.

I saw this movie as a little kid and from then – until I got the chance to work with an environmental NGO – my passion and obsession was becoming a marine biologist. However, once I got to pursue this interest at the WWF, where I analyzed datasets pertaining to different ecosystems of the Pacific Ocean, I realized something about myself: it was not the science or the shark itself I found profoundly fascinating, but rather the story. From then onwards I knew my passion was storytelling. However, this short internship taught me something else about myself: I love telling stories with data. Stories that are convincing and that lead to outcomes, since there is evidence to support them. Skipping some non-essential details, and having learned more along the way, I realized that what profoundly drives me within storytelling is media. My mission is to make sure that the stories that are meant to be told reach as many members of the right audience as possible. Without disregarding my inclination to use data in my everyday, I combined these seemingly unrelated passions through my time in college: I double-majored in Economics and Film at UC Berkeley, aiming to learn more about decision-making.Through my club and internship experience, I got to learn about this intersection by conducting meaningful work in entertainment. I explored B2C Marketing, Market Research, Consumer Insights, Experiential Marketing, B2B Marketing, Content Distribution, and Ad Sales. All of these experiences were fantastic and allowed me to “narrow down” my areas of interest to the following: Consumer/Content Insights and Analytics, Marketing/Brand Strategy, Product Marketing & Product Management, Content Distribution & Acquisition, Ad Sales Operations & Planning, and Account Management.
