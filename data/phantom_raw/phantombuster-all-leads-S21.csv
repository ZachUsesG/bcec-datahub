And while I was unable to particularly identify what that may be, my experiences in different clubs and with different individuals helped narrow my career interests to specific fields like media, digital marketing, product management, administration and more.My most recent full-time role was a niche industry that focused on automotive media. While I would not consider myself an auto enthusiast that gets excited about ICEs or latest trims, I found it to be an amazing opportunity to try and learn something new. It’s truly amazing to be surrounded by passionate and hard-working individuals; allowing myself to be open minded offers new perspectives, knowledge, and experiences. In my next role, I hope to work for a company with personnel that recognizes my strengths and potential. I love when I can gain hands-on experience in a collaborative and interactive setting. Personally, I thrive in supportive environments that offer constructive criticism/accountability while also allowing the freedom to make my own decisions without micromanagement.

I also host weekly LIVE resume and LinkedIn review sessions on TikTok, which have drawn 120K+ unique viewers since May and grown my platform by 9K+ followers, giving me direct feedback loops that translate into action-ready insights.On the brand side, I’ve produced ~32 short-form videos monthly for K-beauty brands at Memebox, developed training videos for 100K+ Macy’s and Ulta sales associates, and optimized creative variants to improve ad conversions. At Udemy, I launched the brand’s Threads presence, landed PR coverage in top media outlets including Forbes, won 4 product & company awards, and leveraged analytics dashboards to construct quarterly learning indexes that identified trends in global workplace learning. I even generated $2.7M+ EMV via influencer campaigns and tripled the TikTok following for Anastasia Beverly Hills by introducing new content formats.Whether building creator-led campaigns, shaping social strategy, or translating audience behavior into product insights, I thrive at the intersection of storytelling, data, and community.Let's connect!","Creator Ecosystems, Social Listening, Trend Research, Community Building, Campaign Performance Analysis, Search Engine Optimization (SEO), Sprout Social, Asana, CapCut Video Editing, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Canva, ChatGPT, Dash Hudson, Tribe Dynamics, User Generated Content, MailChimp, Product Management, Product Launch Planning, Agency Relationship Management, Microsoft Excel",Memebox Corp (YC W14),https://linkedin.com/company/memebox-corp,memebox-corp,Content Creator & Campaign Strategist,Apr 2024 - Present,San Francisco Bay Area,"• Top performing creator in the “Career” vertical for Lemon8’s hand-selected Creator Program, producing 20-30 posts/month with 10K+ followers.• Created 5 short-form video ads for Lemon8 to promote across TikTok to drive app sign-ups.","• Created long-form training assets for 70K+ employees across 2 major U.S. retailers, supporting Macy’s M-Star and Ulta launch rollouts for Kaja.• Produced 24–32 short-form videos per month across social, ads, and e-comm for 2 brands (3M+), leveraging CapCut and in-app editors.• Delivered a viral IG Reel with 6.5M+ views that added 10K+ followers in 2 weeks, producing a spike in related product searches & sales.• Partnered with paid media to test creative variants, generating 2 top-performing ads in June/July 2024.• Owned social media strategy, content creation, and community management for 3 key product and retail launches in Q3 and Q4 2025.","University of California, Berkeley, Haas School of Business",https://www.linkedin.com/school/berkeley-haas,berkeley-haas,"Bachelor of Science, Business Administration; Sutardja Certificate in Entrepreneurship & Technology",,,West Valley College,https://www.linkedin.com/school/west-valley-college,west-valley-college,,,,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?facetNetwork=%5B%22F%22%5D&facetConnectionOf=%5B%22ACoAACXxvYcBX5HLL9iMZsLv3vNnQUDcNUL5iJ0%22%5D&origin=MEMBER_PROFILE_CANNED_SEARCH&RESULT_TYPE=PEOPLE,hshirley,lemon8app,636599687,ACoAACXxvYcBX5HLL9iMZsLv3vNnQUDcNUL5iJ0,No,No,6494972825398637,Out of Network,12/22/2025,12/22/2025,SP21,SP22

I saw this movie as a little kid and from then – until I got the chance to work with an environmental NGO – my passion and obsession was becoming a marine biologist. However, once I got to pursue this interest at the WWF, where I analyzed datasets pertaining to different ecosystems of the Pacific Ocean, I realized something about myself: it was not the science or the shark itself I found profoundly fascinating, but rather the story. From then onwards I knew my passion was storytelling. However, this short internship taught me something else about myself: I love telling stories with data. Stories that are convincing and that lead to outcomes, since there is evidence to support them. Skipping some non-essential details, and having learned more along the way, I realized that what profoundly drives me within storytelling is media. My mission is to make sure that the stories that are meant to be told reach as many members of the right audience as possible. Without disregarding my inclination to use data in my everyday, I combined these seemingly unrelated passions through my time in college: I double-majored in Economics and Film at UC Berkeley, aiming to learn more about decision-making.Through my club and internship experience, I got to learn about this intersection by conducting meaningful work in entertainment. I explored B2C Marketing, Market Research, Consumer Insights, Experiential Marketing, B2B Marketing, Content Distribution, and Ad Sales. All of these experiences were fantastic and allowed me to “narrow down” my areas of interest to the following: Consumer/Content Insights and Analytics, Marketing/Brand Strategy, Product Marketing & Product Management, Content Distribution & Acquisition, Ad Sales Operations & Planning, and Account Management.

For as long as I can remember, I have strived to inspire and make others happier through my creativity and imagination. I developed my passions for content creation in the classroom of my middle school yearbook club. And in those years prior to attending college, I found myself sinking into perfecting the smallest of details and bringing my joy to those around me. At UC Berkeley, I pushed my message further by tapping into the world of business, marketing, and analytics. My love for creating and visualizing stories conceived itself in projects I worked on for companies such as Snapchat and Adobe. With internships at Warner Bros. Discovery and NBCUniversal, I continued to enhance my skills and worked alongside industry professionals to touch the lives of millions. My mission of utilizing and spreading creativity does not stop at the jobs and projects I have worked on. UC Berkeley's CalTV and BCEC are heavily at the root of guiding me to who I am today and who I want to be in the future. By taking on leadership positions here, I have been able give back and impact others who have similar intentions as myself. At heart, I am someone who just wants to make the world a better place.
