I have also served as the Director of Video Games for the Business Careers in Entertainment Club (BCEC) at Berkeley. In my time in college, I have taken courses within the cognitive science department that have allowed me to learn interesting and varied topics such as human computer interaction, virtual communities and social media, human psychology, and language processing while additionally taking classes focused around game design and development.I am passionate about User Research and UX, with a significant interest in games as a service models (GaaS). As my interest would suggest, I look forward to a career conducting research primarily (but not exclusively) for game development. I feel that when it comes to video game design, research is a key aspect that can determine whether a game will be a success upon release. I know that through extensive testing and research studies, games will not only play smarter, but will offer an experience that aims to support the most important aspect of the industry, the player.I designate a portion of my spare time towards working on small independent projects that center around User Research and UX Design. I have completed the Google UX Design Professional Certificate wherein I learned the basics needed for starting a career in User Experience, as taught by UX professionals at Google. I also conduct research studies surrounding a variety of the games that I play in order to better understand how games are developed and why developers make the decisions that they do. I am particularly fond of looking at live games that implore the use of DLC and expansions in order to maintain longevity of their game, a model commonly known as ""games as a service.""During the times when I am not working on independent projects I like playing video games (some of my favorites include Super Metroid, Destiny 2, World of Warcraft, and almost every Sonic the Hedgehog game), cooking fantastic and creative meals, listening to informative podcasts, and spending time with my partner watching Kitchen Nightmares reruns.Please feel free to contact me at ianalejandrohunter@gmail.com or learn more on my personal portfolio: https://ianalejandrohunter.wixsite.com/my-site","User Experience (UX), UX Research, 1-on-1 Interviews, Qualtrics, Figma (Software), User Personas, User Interviews, Quantitative Surveys, Design Thinking, Prototyping, Games as a Service Systems (GaaS), Unity, C#, Python",University of North Texas,https://linkedin.com/company/northtexas,northtexas,Office Support Assistant,Mar 2022 - Jun 2023,"Denton, Texas, United States",,,"University of California, Berkeley",https://www.linkedin.com/school/uc-berkeley,uc-berkeley,Bachelor of Arts (B.A.),2016 - 2021,,,,,,,,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?facetNetwork=%5B%22F%22%5D&facetConnectionOf=%5B%22ACoAACAdyBwB5NZz1JWknqPvsgcD4kqSciComiU%22%5D&origin=MEMBER_PROFILE_CANNED_SEARCH&RESULT_TYPE=PEOPLE,ian-a-hunter,,538822684,ACoAACAdyBwB5NZz1JWknqPvsgcD4kqSciComiU,No,No,8339348149653850,Out of Network,12/22/2025,12/22/2025,SP18,SP18
